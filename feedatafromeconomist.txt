<title>Business backlash</title>
<description>IN A sign of Enrique Peña Nieto’s weakened stature since a law and order crisis erupted in September, Mexico’s business community will today directly challenge him over a grievance it has nurtured for more than a year. In a face-to-face meeting with the president, the Businessmen’s Coordinating Council, a lobby group, says it will ask him to roll back part of last year’s tax reform. It will also call on his government to cut wasteful spending. Gerardo Gutiérrez Candiani, head of the country’s main business lobby, says the fiscal overhaul that raised taxes last year is the only one of Mr Peña’s reforms that the business community is against, blaming it for putting the brakes on economic growth this year. He said he would propose an immediate reversal of a reform that bars companies from using their investments to offset their tax liabilities. He would also ask for a staggered reduction in income taxes, and propose the reinstatement of other tax write-offs.  This call comes at a delicate time for Mexico. Public finances will eventually be hit by a decline in oil prices (they are currently hedged), and the fiscal deficit is already running near a fairly high 3.5% of GDP this year, a level which the government hopes to stick to in 2015. Mr Gutiérrez says the deficit should not be allowed to rise further. He believes some of his... Continue reading</description>

<title>Back to the table</title>
<description>NOW that the FARC guerrilla army has released the Colombian general it had kidnapped in November, peace talks with the Colombian government can resume. Colombia’s president, Juan Manuel Santos, had suspended the negotiations in Havana after the abduction. The general’s release "helps to create a favourable atmosphere” for continuing them, he said. So far no date has been set for doing so. When the talks resume, will they prosper? The verdict in the Colombian media is that the episode is an encouraging sign. The FARC freed the general, Rubén Dario Alzate (pictured right, after his release), and two travelling companions on Sunday without preconditions. Two Colombian soldiers who had been abducted earlier were released last week. That suggests that the FARC is sensitive to the public outrage that greeted the kidnappings and will make concessions to allay it. It also shows that the FARC remains a cohesive organisation with an effective chain of command. There had been fears that the FARC’s leadership could not control all of the units spread out across a vast... Continue reading</description>

<title>The new brooms</title>
<description>SHE finally did it. Nearly a week after her intentions were trailed in the Brazilian press President Dilma Rousseff, who narrowly won re-election in October, named her new economic team yesterday. Joaquim Levy (pictured above, in focus) will be the new finance minister and Nelson Barbosa (right) the minister of planning. Alexandre Tombini (left) keeps his post at the head of the central bank. As Bello explains this week (in a column written just before the appointments were made official), they portend a big change from the course Ms Rousseff pursued during her first term. Brazil’s GDP report today underscores just why change is needed. The economy grew a negligible 0.1% in the third quarter of 2014, half the expected rate. After two consecutive quarters of shrinking output, the growth in the third quarter ends a technical recession. But it was mainly due to a burst of pre-election spending by the government. As the new economic team tightens fiscal and monetary policy, growth is likely to fall back in the near... Continue reading</description>

<title>Missing the point</title>
<description>On November 27th Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, did what he should have done long ago: he announced a series of measures aimed at making the rule of law a priority of his administration. He did it in response to a groundswell of protest against his government triggered by the disappearance of 43 students in the southern state of Guerrero two months ago. But in failing to acknowledge any responsibility for the crisis, and in failing to challenge the entire political system to clean up its act, he may have missed a chance to turn the tide of public opinion. In a nutshell, he localised the problem. He said he would draft laws to enable the authorities to remove municipal authorities colluding with drug traffickers, as allegedly happened with tragic consequences for the 43 students. He plans to replace Mexico’s 1,800 municipal police forces with 32 state ones. He ordered an immediate deployment of federal forces into areas of organised crime in Guerrero and nearby. He unveiled plans to create special economic zones in the poor south to encourage investment and reduce crime, as well as promising special treatment to poor... Continue reading</description>

<title>Peace interrupted</title>
<description>TALKS between Colombia’s government and the leftist FARC guerrilla army have not been easy. Knotty problems, such as disarmament and reparations for victims of the 50-year-long civil war, were far from being resolved. But there had been progress and talks were set to continue. Then on Sunday FARC kidnapped an army general along with another military official and a civilian in a village close to the provincial capital of Quibdó in northwestern Colombia. The president, Juan Manuel Santos (pictured above), responded by suspending the talks, which had been due to resume in Havana on Tuesday. Just how serious a setback this will be to the two-year-old peace process is unclear. Mr Santos provided a path back to negotiation by saying that the talks would be suspended “until these people are released.” But FARC has so far said nothing about why it nabbed the general, Rubén Darío Alzate, and his companions or what it plans to do with them. "This is the first serious crisis of the peace process," said Jorge Restrepo, director of the Conflict Analysis Resource Centre, a Bogotá think tank. "If FARC do not free the general and his companions... Continue reading</description>

<title>Dilma’s doldrums</title>
<description>AS SHE hobnobs with the other G20 heads of state in Brisbane this weekend, Dilma Rousseff, re-elected last month to a second four-year term as Brazil’s president, will have precious little besides her (narrow) victory to boast about. Every day seems to bring more evidence of just how big a mess she has left herself. Official data released in the past three weeks have shown a bulging budget deficit, falling industrial production and rising poverty. Even the job market, until recently a rare bright spot, with unemployment near historic lows of around 5%, is beginning to falter. This week payroll numbers showed a net loss of 30,000 jobs in October, the worst result for the month since 1999 and well below the average market expectations of a gain of 56,000. Days before a kerfuffle broke out over a bill sent to Congress that would let Ms Rousseff in effect turn a primary fiscal surplus (before interest payments) of 1.9% of GDP promised in the 2014 budget into a deficit. Since the primary balance showed a hole equal to 0.5% of GDP in the nine months to September (because of a pre-election spending splurge), the government was merely facing up to...

<title>After the election, the reckoning</title>
<description>BRAZIL is not the only emerging economy facing headwinds (see article in this week’s print edition). But it is looking particularly wonky. Having narrowly won a second presidential term on October 26th, this week Dilma Rousseff returned from a spot of post-election R&R to a raft of bad news. The trade deficit widened to $1.1 billion in October, the highest-ever for the month. It now stands at $1.8 billion so far this year. Both imports and exports fell, pointing to weak activity. An expected uptick in September’s industrial production turned out instead to have been a dip; it has now shrunk for five straight quarters. Then, on November 5th, it emerged that the ranks of desperately poor Brazilians, unable to afford enough calories to avoid malnutrition, swelled by 371,000 between 2012 and 2013, to 10.4m. This is the first increase since Ms Rousseff’s Workers’ Party (PT) came to power in 2003. It comes as a particular blow to the president, who spent much of the campaign boasting of how much she had done to improve the lot of the indigent. Now it appears that, as the opposition has repeatedly pointed out, social progress under Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who ran the country in 2003-10, has stalled under his...

<title>A gruesome mass murder</title>
<description>THE 43 Mexican student teachers missing since September 26th appear to have been murdered. Their bodies were then incinerated in a remote rubbish tip beyond the south-western town of Iguala, where they went missing, and their remains were tossed in a river, Mexico’s attorney-general, Jesús Murillo Karam, said on November 7th. The macabre revelation may be the most decisive development in a case that has traumatised the country and battered the credibility of President Enrique Peña Nieto. However, it was based on the testimony of three detainees, who allegedly said they had taken part in the disposal of the bodies. Mr Murillo Karam said there was still no DNA evidence proving the charred remains belonged to them. Anguished parents of the victims refused to accept the results because of the lack of proof, which may make it harder for the government to put its worst crisis behind it. There were also questions about how long the authorities had known of the fate of the students, and whether the news was deliberately released shortly before Mr Peña’s planned state visit to China. Mr Murillo Karam delivered the long-awaited account in a... Continue reading</description>

<title>Facebook, feminism and a furore</title>
<description>CANADIANS, like most other people, love stories about how the mighty are fallen. Many of them have been grimly fascinated by the travails of Jian Ghomeshi, who only a couple of months ago was one of the nation's most glamorous media personalities. The radio show that he helped to create in 2007,  Q with Jian Ghomeshi , was heavily promoted by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), which was trying to slough off its staid image with edgy arts programming aimed at young listeners. It was syndicated to 170 radio stations in the United States. But on October 26th, he was dismissed by CBC; his bosses said he had engaged in conduct unbecoming for one of their brightest stars. The following day, Mr Ghomeshi sued his old employers for $55m, alleging that they had defamed him and breached the confidentiality of discussions in which he had spoken frankly about his sexual preferences. Both in the suit and in a posting on Facebook,... Continue reading</description>

<title>Not quite so raucous</title>
<description>THE CURTAIN came down on Monday on four years of often-raucous spectacle at Toronto’s city hall when John Tory, a businessman (pictured), won the race to replace Rob Ford as mayor of Canada’s largest city. Mr Ford, who won international notoriety when he admitted to smoking crack cocaine “in one of my drunken stupors”, dropped out of the mayoral race but remained in office after being diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in September. His brother, Doug Ford, ran in his place. Mr Tory’s margin of victory was slimmer than opinion polls had signalled in the last days of the campaign. He garnered just over 40% of the 1m votes cast, compared with almost 34% for Doug Ford. He has promised to restore civility and sanity to municipal politics and “end the division that has paralysed city hall”. The results indicate that this will be easier said than done. Toronto remains a  sharply divided city of about 2.8m, with the downtown core and more affluent... Continue reading</description>

<title>A broad front advances</title>
<description>IN THE weeks preceding Uruguay’s October 26th presidential elections, the capital of Montevideo was blanketed in political advertisements. Billboards for Tabaré Vázquez (pictured), who was president from 2004 to 2009 and belongs to the current ruling party, the Broad Front, read: “Uruguay will not be stopped.”   For a while, however, it looked like Mr Vázquez might be. Pollsters predicted he would not collect the 50% of votes needed to avoid a run-off, where they thought Luis Lacalle Pou, a flowing-haired, centre-right 41-year-old lawyer and son of a former Uruguayan president, might scrape a victory.   In Uruguay "it is very rare for governments to increase their support base while in power,” says Adolfo Garcé, a political scientist at the University of Social Sciences in Montevideo. Put more simply, “what comes up must come down,” says Luis Eduardo Gonzalez of Cifra, a polling group.   But it seems Mr Vázquez and the Broad Front will prevail this time. Having...

<title>Gone too soon</title>
<description>THE St Louis Cardinals’ 2014 season ended in defeat on October 16th, when the San Francisco Giants advanced to Major League Baseball’s (MLB) World Series by beating them four games to one. But hopes were bright in St Louis that the club would contend for another title next year—in large part because of Oscar Taveras , a 22-year-old outfielder widely regarded as one of the best up-and-coming hitters in the sport. That optimism has abruptly turned to grief. On October 26th Mr Taveras and his girlfriend died in a car accident, when he drove his Chevrolet Camaro into a tree while speeding amidst heavy rains on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic (DR). The sudden loss of such a talented young player cast a pall over the fifth game of the World Series, which was under way when the news broke. With sufficient reflection, though, the shock players and fans felt upon hearing the grim tidings may be partially replaced by surprise that it took this long for a baseball player to be claimed by such a...

<title>A riven country</title>
<description>IT WAS a wild ride. After a tight and tetchy race, marked by innumerable twists and turns, Brazil’s left-wing president, Dilma Rousseff, was re-elected on October 26th to a second four-year term with 51.6% of valid votes. Aécio Neves, of the centre-right opposition, notched up 48.4% . It is the fourth election in a row won by her Workers’ Party (PT). But her margin of victory is the slimmest in Brazilian electoral history. Perhaps Ms Rousseff’s victory was inevitable. Only three Latin American presidents have lost re-election bids in the past three decades. Odds are stacked in favour of incumbents, with all the machinery of power and patronage at their disposal. Ms Rousseff can point to record-low unemployment, rising wages and falling inequality under the PT's watch. But Mr Neves, whom The Economist had endorsed as the better choice, put up a valiant fight, arguing, with good reason, Continue reading</description>

<title>A nail-biter</title>
<description>BY THE time Brazilians pick their president on October 26th they will have few nails left to bite. Three polls published on the eve of the tightest and tetchiest election Brazil has ever seen suggest the race will go to a photo-finish. After trailing Aécio Neves, of the centre-right Party of Brazilian Social Democracy (PSDB), by a whisker, the left-wing incumbent, Dilma Rousseff this week opened up a sizeable six-to-eight point lead. But on the final straight Mr Neves has picked up pace. He still trails by four and six points in surveys by two most reputable pollsters, IBOPE and Datafolha, respectively. But momentum seems once again to be with him. Mr Neves (whom The Economist has endorsed in this election ) has shown a knack for confounding expectations. As Marina Silva, a charismatic centrist, soared in the polls, he looked out of the running. Then, in an unprecedented surge days before the first round on October 5th, propelled by an assured performance in an important televised debate and the PSDB’s... Continue reading</description>

<title>At last, the governor goes</title>
<description>THE resignation on October 23rd of Ángel Aguirre (pictured), governor of the south-western state of Guerrero, where 43 students have been missing for almost a month, has come too late to assuage the anger of Mexicans clamouring for a decisive response to the tragedy. But at least it gives the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto a chance to show more leadership in a crisis that has exposed a lawlessness in parts of the country that it had spent two years trying to disguise. Mr Aguirre´s stubborn refusal to step down appeared only to add to the agony that the country has suffered since the young teacher-trainees went missing on September 26th. They were allegedly abducted by local police in the Guerrero city of Iguala on the orders of a mayor and his wife, who are said to be part of a vicious drug-trafficking cartel. Since their disappearance mass graves have been dug up near Iguala with the remains of burned corpses, but the government says the whereabouts of the students are still unknown. The fugitive Iguala mayor and his wife are from the same leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution as Mr Aguirre, and the former... Continue reading</description>

<title>The cashmere revolution</title>
<description>BUSINESS barons and financiers are not known for taking to the streets. Yet on October 22nd thousands turned out in the centre of São Paulo in support of Aécio Neves, the centre-right challenger to President Dilma Rousseff, of the left-wing Workers’ Party (PT), in a tight run-off election on October 26th. Together with spouses and children they sauntered down São Paulo’s Avenida Faria Lima, a thoroughfare conveniently located close to many of their offices. It was a sight to behold—perhaps unprecedented in election history, and not just in Brazil. Besuited types with crisp, initialed shirts toting “Aécio” flags. Snazzily clad socialites, wrapped in pashminas to keep out the unseasonable chill, chanting anti-PT slogans. Everyone snapping selfies with pricey iPhones (most Brazilian rallies are cheaper Samsung affairs). The only thing missing from this “cashmere revolution” was champagne flutes—and Mr Neves himself, campaigning in his home state of Minas Gerais. “Most of Brazilian GDP is here,” observed one private-equity boss with four Aécio stickers on his checked shirt, shortly after bumping into a pal from...

<title>When fear crosses oceans</title>
<description>An ocean away from Africa’s Ebola outbreak, a deep fear of the disease now runs through the Caribbean. The atmosphere recalls the early days of the AIDS epidemic, some 30 years ago. Trinidad and Tobago’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar (pictured), talks dramatically of “a new darkness, Ebola.” Her government this month recalled delegates en route to a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference in Cameroon, a country unaffected by the current Ebola outbreak. Her doctors and health workers are demanding quadruple pay and $1.6m insurance polices for joining an Ebola response team. There’s talk of cancelling the islands’ annual carnival. Trinidad and Tobago, along with Jamaica, St Kitts-Nevis, St Vincent, St Lucia, Suriname, Guyana and Belize this month banned all travel from African countries with an Ebola outbreak. One reason for the level of fear is the rapid spread of chikungunya , a painful viral disease also of African origin which first reached the Caribbean last December. Anyone who has not yet been struck knows a bunch of people who have. Some islands have recorded cases in the tens of... Continue reading</description>

<title>Tough questions</title>
<description>CANADA'S parliament came under attack on Wednesday from what appears to be a lone gunman, who launched two separate attacks within blocks of each other and then was killed. Although the main parliamentary building was full of MPs for weekly caucus meetings, no one was injured. The prime minister and opposition leaders were all reported safe. But a soldier standing guard at the nearby Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where the first shooting took place, died of his injuries. The centre of Ottawa surrounding the parliamentary precinct, which also encompasses the American embassy and British high commission, was locked down for more than four hours as police pursued what they believed were multiple suspects. Police briefing reporters at midday would not be drawn on whether they were still seeking other suspects. Terrorism is not unknown in Canada, but an attack on parliament still has the power to shock. Its impact has been compounded by an attack earlier this week on two Canadian soldiers at a military college near Montreal. The suspect behind this earlier attack is a Canadian who police say had converted to Islam and become... Continue reading</description>

<title>Dilma edges ahead</title>
<description>BRAZIL is on tenterhooks. With five days to go before the presidential run-off on October 26th the race remains too close to call. But for the first time since the first round of voting two weeks ago the left-wing incumbent, Dilma Rousseff, has gained ground. On October 20th a poll by Datafolha put Ms Rousseff four points ahead of Aécio Neves, her centre-right challenger; last week Mr Neves was leading by a whisker. Perhaps it was only a matter of time. Ms Rousseff’s campaign, as cynical as it is formidable, has relentlessly (and unfairly) bashed the market-friendly Mr Neves for wanting to slash social programmes and govern solely for the rich elite. It has also attacked his record as governor of Minas Gerais, a big state which has just elected a governor from Ms Rousseff’s Workers’ Party (PT) and where she beat Mr Neves in the first round (in part because the opposition vote was split between him and Marina Silva, a charismatic centrist who came third overall). “People who know Aécio don’t vote for him,” blare PT television ads, conveniently omitting to mention that whenever Mr Neves himself stood for elected office in Minas, he...

<title>Car-smugglers and their rights</title>
<description>AFTER hailing a taxi in La Paz recently, your correspondent was intrigued to see that the car’s centre console was in Japanese. Luis Martinez, the driver, chuckled when asked if he was proficient in the Asian language. “Oh, no no. I just messed around until I learned how to work it.” The majority of the cars that clog Bolivia's roads are imported from other countries in a well-used state. In view of their reputation for durability, Japanese brands are especially popular. Mechanics in the country’s border towns are well practised at changing steering wheels of Japanese cars from the right side to the left. Some of these cars, like the one Mr Martinez drives, are brought in legally. But others are smuggled across the borders from Chile, Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil without paying the required tariffs. The provenance of these chutos , or undocumented vehicles, is often highly colourful. There is even a Bolivian joke: "If you buy a used car from Paraguay, you'd better check to make sure its old owner isn’t tied up in the trunk.” Payment methods can also be shady; anecdotal...

<title>Most foul</title>
<description>BOUND and beaten, with multiple stab-wounds to the chest, the body of Robert Serra, a 27-year-old member of parliament for Venezuela’s ruling party, was found at his Caracas home on the night of October 1st. His female assistant, María Herrera, had also been stabbed to death. Even in a country with one of the world’s worst homicide rates, the brutal murder of Serra and Herrera caused public revulsion. But some were just as shocked that, almost before the blood was dry, many leading government spokesmen, including President Nicolás Maduro, were already attributing the crime to “hired killers” working for the opposition. Political assassination is extremely rare in Venezuela, despite the country’s bitter political polarisation between the followers of the late President Hugo Chávez and the opposition, mainly represented by the Democratic Unity (MUD) alliance. MUD leaders immediately condemned the murders and called off a planned demonstration to avoid stirring up animosity. As evidence for its claim, the government pointed to an opposition legislator’s remark in parliament, just days before the murder, that government members’... Continue reading</description>

<title>Warm no more</title>
<description>IN ONE of the most remembered scenes of the film Casablanca, police chief Louis Renault orders the close of Rick's Cafe when he is "shocked, shocked" to learn that there was gambling going on in the establishment. Seconds later a waiter presents Renault with his winnings from roulette. Panama was similarly shocked when Colombia last week included the neighbouring country on its list of tax havens, after the Central American nation failed to meet a deadline to sign a bilateral tax information exchange agreement. “[Panama] is not a tax haven, and we reject being classified this way," Panama's finance Minister Dulcidio de la Guardia said. Panama's outrage led the foreign ministry to insinuate the possibility of retaliation, saying in a statement that the Panamanian government would study unspecified measures against countries that "discriminate against Panama." Panama and Colombia have had historically warm relations  and the Central... Continue reading</description>

<title>Neck and neck</title>
<description>OBSERVERS of Brazil's rollercoaster of a presidential race are becoming inured to surprises. The election's first round on October 5th threw up a big one, when Aécio Neves, of the main centre-right opposition party, rocketed from roughly 20% in polls days earlier to 34%, leaving Marina Silva, a charismatic centrist who at one point seemed poised to defeat the left-wing incumbent, Dilma Rousseff, in the dust. Ms Rousseff came first with 42%, the lowest score for any front-runner since direct elections were re-introduced in 1989. She will slug it out with Mr Neves in the second round on October 26th. Many thus shrugged off the first set of run-off polls, showing the rivals neck and neck. Of course they would, the thinking went, given Mr Neves's recent momentum. But the polls, published by Datafolha and IBOPE on October 9th, were nonetheless historic. Both show Mr Neves at 46%, two points ahead of Ms Rousseff. That may be a statistical tie, but for the first time ever the runner-up in the first round has overtaken the front-runner. As the first round made clear, voter surveys need to be taken with a dollop of salt. IBOPE's exit... Continue reading</description>

<title>Outrage, at last</title>
<description>IT WAS “outrageous, painful and unacceptable”. With those words, Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto echoed the feelings of the nation on October 6th after the discovery of 28 charred bodies, dug up the previous weekend in mass graves near the city of Iguala, 80 miles (125km) southwest of the capital. Though the authorities have not yet publicly identified the corpses, Mr Peña indicated the truth of what everyone suspects: that the victims were among 43 teacher-trainees who went missing after a night of police violence in Iguala on September 26th in which six people were killed. Authorities from the state of Guerrero, Mexico’s most murder-plagued, have arrested 22 Iguala policemen in connection with the disappearances. If confirmed, it would be the worst massacre in almost two years of the president’s tenure. But it may not be the only one (see table). Late last month, the army arrested seven soldiers in connection with the killing in June of 22 people in Tlatlaya, a crime-ridden town 100 miles west of Mexico City. Throughout the summer the official version was that the deaths occurred during a shootout... Continue reading</description>

<title>A hard road from coal to gas</title>
<description>THE LEGISLATORS of British Columbia have convened this week for an autumn session, something that only happens when there is a really pressing item on the agenda. This time, the stakes could hardly be higher, as the government's plans to turn the province into a significant gas exporter, bringing handsome returns to the public exchequer, hang in the balance.  At least 17 projects to produce and ship Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from British Columbia are in various, early stages of development, but in no case has a final investment decision been made. All of them involve bringing gas to overseas markets, mostly in Asia.  The Liberals who run the province say a healthy LNG sector is at the centre of their plan to restore its fiscal health. They hope that LNG will bring it between C$130 billion ($116 billion) and C$260 billion ($232 billion) in new revenue over the next 30 years.  All that, so the theory goes, should help make up for the fact that the province's other big energy export, coal, is in crisis because of falling world prices. Four coal mines have been idled... Continue reading</description>

<title>Britain&#039;s cheering gloom</title>
<description>MY print column this week looks at the deep anger and anti-politics contempt that suffuses national debate in Britain just now. I suggest that British voter rage is oddly encouraging. In lots of debt-ridden western nations, anger at the government is fatalistic, almost nihilistic, and too often focuses on preserving a crumbling status quo and clinging desperately to dwindling sectoral privileges. In Britain, I would argue, voter rage is more constructive: if people are furious about what they see as the unfairness of life in today's Britain that is because they expect it to feel fair. The column is below. Before that, I feel I should apologise for my very limited blogging over the last month or so. At very short notice, I have been posted to Washington DC. Indeed, I caught a plane two hours after filing my last Bagehot column and am now writing these words in the American capital. Organising the move in a hurry left no time for this blog, to my regret. Mine was a briefer than expected stay in Britain. After watching the country from afar for so many years, it was a great opportunity to report on my homeland, an outlier in so many ways, and something of a canary in the mine for the cause of free market liberalism. Your comments have been instructive, I always read every one, as I did in a previous life as Charlemagne, and will again in the late summer when I... Continue reading</description>

<title>A Brixit looms</title>
<description>MY PRINT column this week considers the political implications in Britain of the deepening euro crisis: DAVID CAMERON does not want Britain to leave the European Union, though he finds it exasperating and fears euro-zone meltdown could cost him re-election. His Liberal Democrat coalition partner, Nick Clegg, is a pro-European. Nor does the Labour opposition leader, Ed Miliband, want out. Mr Miliband is a European social democrat by instinct (his relatives were refugees from the Holocaust) and by judgment, seeing the EU as a way of delivering public goods such as action on climate change. Yet the chances of Britain leaving the EU in the next few years are higher than they have ever been. A Brixit looms for several reasons. For one thing, the British never fell in love with Europe, instead weighing costs against economic benefits. Right now the EU is seen as a basket case (though British finances are hardly in great shape). For another, if euro-zone members overcome their differences and integrate much more deeply, they would arguably be leaving Britain, especially if their integration fragments the single market that is the bedrock of British membership. Mr Cameron and his chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, may talk of the euro's “remorseless logic” compelling richer members to stand behind the weak. But there are paths of...

<title>George Osborne&#039;s horrible spring</title>
<description>MY PRINT column this week listens to a chorus of criticism about George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, and considers which bits might matter. EVER since he delivered his budget to Parliament on March 21st, troubles have rained down on George Osborne. He has U-turned and dodged, to the press's glee. The chancellor's colleagues ask whether he is steering Britain on the right course, amid the most perilous economic storms in memory. Some on the right of the Conservative Party loudly assail the chancellor, accusing him of lacking a credible plan for growth. They roll their eyes at Mr Osborne's blame-shifting argument that a British recovery, already slowed by high oil prices and debts bequeathed by the previous Labour government, is being “killed off” by chaos in the euro zone. The euro is a menace, such right-wingers agree. That is why a proper Tory chancellor would call for its early break-up, not urge European colleagues to save it. A second group, among them lots of Tory MPs first elected in 2010, is less critical than crestfallen after a run of missteps from a man they had thought the political genius of their generation. A final group of worriers includes figures close to the Conservative leadership (as well as allies of Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democratic bit of the coalition). These quiet...

<title>The UKIP insurgency</title>
<description>MY COLUMN this week is about UKIP, the British political party campaigning for withdrawal from the EU. ANGRY insurgents rarely prosper in British politics. Two big things help explain this: voting rules and sniggering. Britain's first-past-the-post voting system is rather brutal to small parties. And if electoral rules do not snare a would-be demagogue then mocking laughter probably will. It is a brave politician who stands before British voters, face red and voice shaking with fury. There is always the risk that at some climactic moment a heckler will interrupt, posing a variant on the ancient British question: just who do you think you are? How, then, to explain the rise of Nigel Farage, leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), an insurgent (and at times quite angry) outfit devoted to Britain's withdrawal from the European Union? Once a near-irrelevance, UKIP haunts the thoughts of politicians across Westminster. The explanation lies in Mr Farage's talent for turning both Britain's voting system and its traditions of pomposity-pricking mockery to his advantage. UKIP does not need to win a single House of Commons seat at the next general election to have an outsized impact. The party just needs to threaten, credibly, to siphon off enough Conservative votes to deny David Cameron's party victory in a... Continue reading</description>

<title>Some ideas for improving Britain&#039;s relations with Europe. Why they may not work</title>
<description>WEARY readers may find this hard to believe, but Bagehot tries hard to ration the amount that he writes about the European Union. After five years in Brussels from 2005 to 2010, including three writing the Charlemagne column for this newspaper, I am acutely conscious of the need not to dwell too much on one aspect of British policy. Alas, the story of Britain's relations with Europe comes under the heading complicated but important (or even, a lot of the time, boring but important). As patient readers may have noticed from a few columns and blog postings over the past few months, I think that Britain's relationship with the EU is in pretty ropey shape. Some of that is the fault of British politicians, quite a lot of it is not. Though accused here in London of being a hand-wringing Euro-quisling, I was taxed in Brussels with being a swivel-eyed Anglo-Saxon ultra-liberal Eurosceptic. I like to think that leaves me, in political terms, doggy-paddling somewhere in the middle of the English Channel dodging the ferries. But it's not for me to judge. But I confess that in my reporting around Westminster and in my contacts with the government and opposition, I do try to keep an eye on what is happening with the euro-debate. It helps that the clan of people in London interested in Europe (whether pro-European or Eurosceptic) is pretty small. So like devotees of some... Continue reading</description>

<title>Order, order</title>
<description>MY PRINT column this week is a profile of John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons: NOTHING in Britain's constitutional traditions obliges the Speaker of the House of Commons to woo voters. Within the Gothic halls of the Palace of Westminster, the Speaker is a mini-monarch, escorted to the chamber by a mace-bearer, a doorkeeper and a chaplain, while a policeman shouts at people to remove their hats. From his canopied chair, the Speaker can summon the prime minister to explain himself and silence the mightiest office-holder with a glance. The incumbent, John Bercow, comes from a safe seat, Buckingham, which he first won as a Conservative in 1997 but now holds as the non-partisan Speaker. Yet one recent Friday Bagehot watched Mr Bercow criss-cross the West Midlands, wooing the public as if days from a crunch election and ten points behind. After an early train from London (second class tickets, an entourage of two) the day ranged from the dignity of a formal lecture to events that would leave a non-politician pink-cheeked with embarrassment. There was a speech to football coaches that had to be delivered at a bellow in one corner of a noisy sports hall. There was a photo opportunity in a bus station, involving Mr Bercow, a local MP, a mayor in a gold chain and a bus named after a local war hero. All gamely grinned for the camera while...

<title>What the Diamond Jubilee says about Britain</title>
<description>QUEEN Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee celebrations are just over a week away. My print column this week ponders what royal jubilees reveal about Britain. BEFORE Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee in 1977, the villagers of West Hoathly in Sussex were placed under secret observation. A file was drawn up, noting their views on the monarchy, the country and the impending celebrations. The royal family was marvellous but these festivities had better not cost too much, said one villager, recorded as “Nurse, female, 50”, explaining: “People are not in the mood.” West Hoathly was reliably monarchist, the file records, with anti-republican sentiment boosted by recent American elections (“Fancy having Jimmy Carter,” a villager shuddered). But still its Jubilee enthusiasts sounded a bit bleak. We're due a celebration, said “Male, 53”—we've made it to 1977 without a nuclear war. The files were commissioned by Mass Observation, a private social-research project that has studied the British since the 1930s. In all, 107 volunteers were recruited to record the Silver Jubilee. Their diaries and notes, together with complementary files on the 2002 Golden Jubilee, now form part of a vast archive held at Sussex University. On the eve of Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee—to be marked from June 2nd to 5th—the archives offer a... Continue reading</description>

<title>President Hollande&#039;s first tax refugee sighted in London?</title>
<description>IT BEING Friday, I hope readers will tolerate a snippet of breaking news from the streets of South Kensington, nerve centre of the French expatriate community in London. Bicycling down the Fulham Road a short while ago, Bagehot was passed by a gleaming Aston Martin, twin exhausts rumbling like a freight train, and French number plates (33 code, so from Bordeaux, at a guess). I was all ready to shout: "Bloody asylum seekers" at the driver, but decided the gag might not work in translation.</description>

<title>The chances of a British referendum on EU membership are growing</title>
<description>THE war drums are pounding among those dreaming of a referendum on EU membership. As noted in a post last week , Peter Mandelson, the former Labour cabinet minister, co-inventor of Blairism and ex-European Union trade commissioner, stirred things up with a lecture at Oxford University, suggesting that pro-Europeans (of whom he is one) should support such a vote, if and when euro-zone integration deepens to such an extent that Britain finds itself an associate member of a two-tier club. Lord Mandelson's democratic analysis was hard to dispute. He noted that 56% of respondents want a referendum on British membership. He also noted that the mandate secured by the government of Edward Heath in the only ever British referendum on Europe, in 1975, "belongs to another time and another generation". A few days after Lord Mandelson's speech, the Spectator magazine's political editor, James Forsyth, quoted a source “intimately involved in Tory electoral strategy” who stated that it was “basically a certainty” that the next Conservative general election manifesto would contain a promise to hold an EU...

<title>House repairs</title>
<description>MY PRINT column this week looks at the politics of House of Lords reform, and suggests that this dry-sounding subject is actually a rather important clash about power and its transmission. SOME years back the BBC enjoyed a surprise hit with a spoof chat-show presented by Mrs Merton, a fictional northern housewife whose trick was skewering guests with mock-naive questions. One noted interview, with a willowy beauty married to a diminutive magician, featured the query: “So, what first attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?” The concept of the “Mrs Merton question” duly entered the national lexicon. Far from the world of sequins and greasepaint, Bagehot recently interviewed a political grandee about constitutional reforms being explored by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. The grandee expressed passionate opposition to a planned change that—it so happened—would disadvantage his own political party. This is a Mrs Merton question, Bagehot ventured—as in: what explains your principled objections to this reform that might cost your party the next election? The grandee pondered this impertinence but did not immediately respond. Yet, a while later, asked to explain his party's dislike of another constitutional reform, he murmured: “Mrs Merton reasons.” Mrs Merton's spirit may need summoning once more, after...

<title>Britain says no to elected mayors</title>
<description>A WHILE back, debate gripped David Cameron's inner circle, on the subject of how to persuade a sceptical British public to embrace elected city mayors. A rather abstruse ambition to outsiders, the creation of elected mayors in towns and cities across Britain has been a gleam in the eye of those close to the prime minister since their days in opposition. Those insiders have had a rough day , with nine out of ten cities that were holding referendums on whether to move to an elected mayor rejecting the idea. Manchester,  Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield, Wakefield, Coventry, Leeds and Bradford voted No. Only Bristol was in favour. In a separate vote, Doncaster voted to keep its mayor. What went wrong? Left to his own devices, Steve Hilton, Mr Cameron's shoe-shunning head of policy and long-time political friend, would have imposed mayors all over the country, in a Big Bang designed to shock and awe the forces of municipal reaction into submission. Mr Hilton's dreams were partly inspired by France, where even the tiniest commune has an elected leader in a tricouleur sash, well-known to local electors—“Bonsoir, Monsieur le Maire”—and thus accountable to them, and representing authority devolved to the lowest possible level....

<title>Should Britain&#039;s government offer an in-out referendum on EU membership?</title>
<description>DESPITE stiff competition from local and mayoral election results involving almost 200 local authorities across England, Wales and Scotland, Peter Mandelson, the former Labour cabinet minister, co-inventor of Blairism and ex-European Union trade commissioner, is set to make headlines this afternoon by calling for Britain to hold an in-out referendum on EU membership. Voices on the Tory right have already reacted with enthusiasm, with ConservativeHome arguing that David Cameron should follow Lord Mandelson's lead and announce an in-out referendum. Con Home explicitly says that the value of such a vote would be to neutralise the threat from the United Kingdom Independence Party, the anti-EU protest party which is today being credited or blamed (depending on who is doing the reporting) with triggering defeats for the Conservatives in such previous Tory strongholds as Thurrock in Essex and Tunbridge Wells in Kent. Some caveats are needed at this point. Nobody is expecting UKIP to pick up lots of seats in the House of Commons at the next general election. There is considerable polling and focus group evidence that Europe is not, in fact, the top issue for core UKIP voters, who... Continue reading</description>

<title>Selling Britain to the world</title>
<description>MY PRINT column this week reports on William Hague's recent visit to south-east Asia and what it reveals about the Foreign Secretary's vision for British foreign policy. The essence of British diplomacy Hague-style, I suggest, can be summed up in a phrase I watched him utter in a crowded lecture theatre in Hanoi: friendliness mixed with self-interest. You can add to that Mr Hague's hunch that all diplomacy, deep down, is bilateral, and his insistence that Britain needs to "get over" its neuroses about post-imperial decline or its sometimes tetchy relations with Europe, and instead focus on selling its best assets (he cites things such as Britain's armed forces, her universities, civil servants and service industries). The end result, I conclude, is that Mr Hague is making a bet that Britain will mostly have to look after herself in the next phase of globalisation. He may be right, but if he is to win that bet, Britain will have to ensure that it really does have world-class services, products and capabilities to sell. That will involve unprecedented effort and hard work. Are we British ready to work that hard? I hope so, but I am not sure. Here is the column.   BLUSHING lightly, the Vietnamese undergraduate had a question for William Hague. Britain's foreign secretary... Continue reading</description>

<title>If Tom Watson really believes Rupert Murdoch is a menace, why didn&#039;t he work for a cross-party report condemning him?</title>
<description>TOM Watson, the Labour MP who has done more than most members of the British Parliament to uncover wrongdoing within the media companies run by Rupert Murdoch, likes to compare the Murdoch press to an organised crime gang. Tiring of claims by James Murdoch—the patriarch's son and a former boss of the firm's British media interests—that he knew nothing of illegal behaviour in his firm's tabloid newsrooms, Mr Watson famously called him “the first mafia boss in history who didn't know he was running a criminal enterprise”. Mr Watson has just published a book, "Dial M for Murdoch, News Corporation and the corruption of Britain", which makes a passionate case that News Corp and its British arm, News International, behaved for years like a "secret state", to a degree that threatened British democracy itself. At its readable best, the book— which I reviewed for last week's print edition of The Economist —has the moral force and anger of a prosecutorial summing-up of the case against Mr Murdoch. (The book is less good, I argued, at answering a harder question: how to craft new forms of oversight and media-ownership rules that work, leaving Britain with a free press that is less horrible but still profitable.) Yet today we were reminded that Mr Watson, a loyal ally of... Continue reading</description>

<title>Why do people defend failing schools, but not failing hospitals?</title>
<description>CHARLOTTE Leslie, the thoughtful new Conservative MP for Bristol North West, makes an interesting suggestion in today's Daily Telegraph . Given that improving the quality of teachers is a big part of the vital task of improving British state education, and given that professions such as medicine have no trouble attracting high-quality recruits, might there be useful lessons for the educational establishment to learn from the professional training given to surgeons? Ms Leslie, the daughter of a surgeon, notes that ministers have spent years wrestling with the puzzle of giving good teachers the freedom to teach while preventing bad teachers from wrecking the lives of children. Their solution to that puzzle has, all too often, been political interference in the classroom, with ministers setting out "national literacy and numeracy strategies", backed by endless targets and tests. This would not happen in medicine, she writes: For all the political control over the structures of the NHS, what actually goes on in the operating theatre – what is acceptable practice, what new techniques and medicines should be introduced – remains firmly in the hands of the people who know it best: the...

<title>Are British newspapers a menace to democracy?</title>
<description>BAGEHOT spent today in Singapore on the final leg of a trip watching the British foreign secretary at work in Asia. A future column will discuss Britain's new foreign policy plans, but this week's print column—written from the road—examines a furore back home triggered by the latest hearings of the Leveson inquiry into press ethics. Ripples from the debate about the British press, and its unhealthily swaggering relations with the country's political leaders, reached Asia all week. To my slight surprise, I found myself watching Leveson coverage live at Hong Kong airport, courtesy of CNN, caught up on more footage late at night on streaming video, and my Blackberry hummed with endless headlines. Why is a row about British domestic press regulation global news? Is it because British newspapers and newspaper tycoons really are a menace to democracy? I am not sure. In part, of course, it is because Ruper Murdoch, the tycoon whose evidence made most waves this week, is a global media baron. But in part, I argue in this column, Britain simply has a very odd media market. Here's the column: WHEN Britain's biggest tabloid claimed credit for a Conservative general election victory with the front-page headline “It's the Sun wot won it”, its proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, was not pleased. Giving evidence on April 25th to a public... Continue reading</description>

<title>Britain&#039;s educational secret weapon: chilly rigour</title>
<description>“YOU don't see many white people round here,” said the American lecturer, visibly startled to encounter Bagehot at the Banking Academy of Vietnam, a sprawling finance college in a far-flung district of Hanoi. Actually, on this particular morning there were two more Europeans upstairs, giving an economics lecture on the optimal level of managerial ownership in a British company (not too little, but not too much either, I can report, otherwise managers start hoarding cash). But learning was not really the point this morning. This visit by two academics from a branch of London University was really a thinly-disguised sales pitch, advertising the joys of studying in far-off Britain. Vietnam is a young country—a quarter of the population are under 15—and its local universities are a source of endless complaint among the rising middle class. The teaching is pretty patchy, and students are obliged to leave their core studies to study such irrelevances as family planning, military drill and “ideology”. As a result, Vietnam is seen as a boom market for western universities, notably in Britain, the top overseas destination for students from Hanoi (the southern middle classes from Ho Chi Minh City favour American and Australian colleges, reflecting both the legacy of American influence in southern Vietnam, and family ties to émigré communities...

<title>The British government&#039;s prosperity agenda hits the road</title>
<description>REPORTING from a summit some years ago, your correspondent found himself following the foreign minister of another country into a press conference. The foreign minister in question, a celebrated public intellectual at home, was strolling at an easy lope into the room when his attention was caught by something to his left. The distraction, it turned out, was the minister's own reflection in the shiny glass of an interpreter's booth. The ministerial hand rose and came to rest on the ministerial hair, its owner oblivious to the British journalist just behind him. Pat, pat, smooth, went the hand. A last check. A nod. Oh yes. Looking good. And in we went. Tonight, Bagehot is in Hanoi, watching a rather different foreign minister, William Hague, on a tour of south-east Asia. Keeping up with the British foreign secretary involves more jogging than loping, it turns out. There is a minimum of fuss. Landing at Hanoi, his small delegation of officials cantered through the airport, unnoticed by milling passengers. Shaven-headed and crisply suited, were it not for his Yorkshire accent and red ministeral box in hand, he could have been an American CEO, in town to inspect a new production site. Taking office, the Conservative-led coalition vowed a new, business-centred approach to foreign policy. Trade and prosperity would be the watchword, rather than grandiose schemes to...

<title>Why elected mayors matter</title>
<description>MY PRINT column this week is from Bristol, one of ten English cities that on May 3rd are holding a referendum on whether to have a directly elected mayor. There are larger cities holding votes on the same day, such as Birmingham, and cities that are convulsed by angrier rows about the quality of their local councils, such as Nottingham. But Bristol offers a particularly pure case study of what is at stake. Power has changed hands many times in the last decade in Bristol City Council, with coups, ambushes, partial elections and backroom deals bringing down minority administrations and wobbly, ad-hoc coalitions. As a result, by the count of Conservative ministers in London the post of council leader (chosen from among the 70 elected local councillors after deal-making among the dominant party blocks) has changed hands seven times in the past ten years, though this is disputed by the current council bosses. Add in a quirk that the council holds partial elections in three years out of every four, and the sad result is that many Bristolians are thoroughly sick of local democracy. In the words of a piece of graffiti sighted in the tough St Paul's district of the city: "Whoever you vote for, the council wins". All this rule by fudge, huddle and horse-trading has undermined accountability, and weakened any sense that voters can sanction policies they dislike, and reward... Continue reading</description>

<title>Why the debate over British shale gas extraction is for high stakes</title>
<description>THE BRITISH debate about shale gas extraction has made headlines today, following the publication of a government-commissioned study suggesting that the unconventional drilling technique can safely be tested further, despite apparently causing two small earthquakes near the northern resort town of Blackpool. The domestic argument is already trundling along familiar tramlines. Environmental campaign groups and left-wing newspapers have expressed concern, arguing that it would be better to focus on renewable energy sources. Right-wing newspapers have accused green activists of having a "general hostility to fossil fuels". Similar debates can be found in several countries which have looked into the use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to unlock gas and oil deposits from rock formations with the help of high-pressure injections of water and chemicals. Yet the British debate could turn out to have an international twist, and one that makes it edgier than most. My understanding, briefly referred to in the print Bagehot column published last week,...

<title>Cutty Sark Britain</title>
<description>MY PRINT column this week looks at a question that is coming to dominate British debate about Europe: is EU membership an economic advantage, or is it dragging us down? OTHER countries show off warships or the vessels of great explorers. It says something about Britain that one of its best-loved ships, the Cutty Sark , was built for trade. After long repairs, the three-masted tea clipper will reopen to the public on April 26th in a new setting at Greenwich—her racing lines and brass-sheathed hull held in a lattice of glass and steel so that visitors may walk aboard, around and beneath her. Launched in 1869 at the peak of British commercial power, the Cutty Sark was a response to globalisation. The abolition of protectionist laws had opened China-to-Britain shipping routes to fast American boats, capable of winning the lucrative annual race to London with the new tea harvest. Manned by sailors from a half-dozen nations, the Cutty Sark was built to win the tea race, at such high cost that her shipyard went bankrupt. Dogged by ill luck (a broken rudder, a captain eaten by sharks) she never won a China race, but later made a packet as the fastest ship on the Australian wool run. Today her bowsprit points across the Thames at another symbol of global Britain: the glass towers of the Canary Wharf... Continue reading</description>

<title>David Cameron&#039;s bad week</title>
<description>MY PRINT column this week looks back at a run of grim headlines for David Cameron and his coalition government, and questions the idea that his biggest problem is being exposed as an out-of-touch toff: “LET'S not mince words,” said one of the Conservative Party's heavy-hitters: our party has come to be seen as arrogant, selfish and—fatally—“out of touch”. The out-of-touch charge has rung in the ears of David Cameron and his closest ally, George Osborne, this week, after days of unforced errors. Lowlights included a party fund-raiser filmed allegedly offering access to ministers for donations, bungled preparations for a fuel-delivery strike and angry headlines about a budget that noisily cut the 50% top income-tax rate while sneakily raising tax on pensioners and hot bakery snacks (serious stuff: the British like their pasties). The prime minister's net approval rating, measured by the pollster YouGov, fell 16 points in a single week, to a record low of -27. Much advice has been offered by Tories in Parliament and by the press: cull the suave “chums of Dave” who fill Downing Street; hire a new party chairman; give more ministerial posts to northern or working-class MPs; ditch totems of party modernisation such as support for gay marriage, and focus on proper, Conservative policies like bashing Europe and slashing...

<title>Intruding on the Easter of others</title>
<description>SHORTLY before Christmas, Bagehot wrote a rather grumpy column about the Church of England , arguing that a time of national austerity and general economic soul-searching was a big test for the national church, which I suspected its leaders were currently failing. True, there were the Occupy London protestors camped out on the steps of St Paul's Cathedral, and yes, the Archbishop of Canterbury and assorted bishops were regularly making headlines by speaking out against public spending cuts, criticising the government and generally fretting about austerity. But the Occupy protestors had only ended up at the cathedral by accident, I noted. They wanted to camp in the London stock exchange but were prevented by security guards, forcing them onto the nearest open space around St Paul's. More seriously, I was struck by how seldom Church of England leaders mentioned religion or God in their essays, editorials and open letters. More often, I grumbled, sounded like shop stewards for the welfare state, defending specific benefits or attacking specific cuts. That was their right, I agreed: the Anglican church was an early enthusiast for the welfare state (indeed, the very term was coined by an archbishop of Canterbury). But is defending welfare enough, I wondered? Follow the logic to the end, and citizens fulfil... Continue reading</description>

<title>Another reason why the Tory right are wrong about gay marriage</title>
<description>ACCORDING to the Daily Telegraph' s well-researched front-page offering this morning—"Tory MPs round on Cameron and Osborne"—the gay marriage thing made it onto the list of stink-bombs lobbed at David Cameron during a "robust" private meeting last week with senior Tory backbenchers. As I mentioned last week, I struggle to see the link between gay weddings and the government's recent, genuine offences against competence: a poorly-presented budget, and advice on preparing for a petrol strike that failed to take into account the detail that British motorists, when panicked, have the rational capacity of hens. But there you go. For a certain sort of MP, Mr Cameron's enthusiastic support for gay marriage clearly remains a talismanic blunder, that exposes his failings as an out-of-touch elitist surrounded by amoral metropolitans. When it comes to the ethics of gay marriage, I think I am right to support it (on grounds of equality, human kindness, the evidence that it improves the lives of thoroughly decent, upstanding gay citizens and simple good manners). Socially conservative MPs do not agree. But assuming that we must agree to disagree on the ethics, here are two more cynical, electoral arguments in favour of Mr... Continue reading</description>

<title>Wait till the Sun hears that the EU won&#039;t let George Osborne reverse the pasty tax</title>
<description>THE Tory tabloids are still seething about what they are calling the "pasty tax", or George Osborne's decision to end the VAT exemption on sausage rolls, pasties, freshly roasted chickens and the like that are sold hot over shop counters or in supermarkets, for munching elsewhere. The Sun devotes two pages to the question and a leader, and links to a petition got up by the National Association of Master Bakers, demanding that the tax break be re-instated. They had better hurry. I blush to admit it, but five years covering the European Union left me quite the connoisseur of VAT rules (you lucky people). And VAT is a one-way ratchet of a tax, thanks to its role in funding the EU budget. Put simply, the EU doesn't like VAT exemptions or special low rates. It cannot do much about those that already exist, because tax rules are decided by unanimity among all 27 member countries. But if a national government ever gives up a national VAT exemption, it is gone forever (unless all 26 other member countries can be persuaded to show mercy). Scanning the fine print of the 2012 budget , VAT is going to be slapped on hot shop-sold food from October 1st this... Continue reading</description>

<description>LITTLE more than four years ago we launched our  Africa blog, Baobab, with little fanfare. Instead we dived straight into coverage of the issues of the day with a  post  from an election monitor in Somaliland. The time has now come to say farewell. The continent is as newsworthy and exciting as ever and we will continue to write additional articles to those that appear in the print edition every week. But these pieces will now be posted on the Middle East and Africa page . Our aim is to make our website easier for new visitors to navigate by reducing the number of blogs, many of which have rather esoteric names; it is not immediately obvious, even to hardened Economist fans, that the place to look for Africa news is a blog called Baobab. Our new online-only articles will be as wide-ranging as our posts on Baobab have been, taking readers from Cape Town to the Horn of Africa and many places along the way. And—we hope—they will offer even deeper analysis than before.</description>

<title>All foreigners out! Well, some of you</title>
<description>AN EDICT issued by South Sudan’s ministry of labour on September 16th caused international havoc by telling all foreigners working in the country (save diplomats and government aid agencies) to leave within a month. But the next day the foreign minister, responding to the ensuing uproar in diplomatic, humanitarian and business circles, back-pedalled by saying that foreigners could stay if no qualified local person could be found to do the job. If the original edict had been enacted, it could have spelt economic and humanitarian disaster for a fledgling country already mired in civil war, penury and administrative chaos. Tariq Riebl, director of Oxfam GB in South Sudan, is one of many influential foreigners who immediately urged the government to change its mind, arguing that the measure, if implemented, “would massively disrupt aid programmes across the country which feed over 1m people. South Sudan is on a knife-edge and could easily tip into famine in 2015.” Oxfam alone says it reaches 300,000 vulnerable people. The anti-foreigner move seems to have been driven by the frustration of locals who grumble that too many jobs—including in hotels, banks, services and the oil industry—are held by outsiders, especially from neighbouring Uganda and Kenya., who tend to be better-qualified, more efficient and more entrepreneurial; three-quarters of South...

<title>Blade runner, the judge’s cut</title>
<description>OSCAR PISTORIUS, South Africa’s celebrated disabled athlete, was found guilty of negligently killing his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. The trial and verdict shed light on both the country’s gun culture and high levels of crime as well as a judiciary once synonymous with apartheid that has since become a jewel of its democracy. Few of the facts of the case were contested. Both prosecution and defence agreed that late one night in February 2013 Mr Pistorius fired four shots from a gun through the closed door of his bathroom, striking and killing Ms Steenkamp. But prosecutors and Mr Pistorius disagreed over why he fired and whether his actions were reasonable. Mr Pistorius says he thought that there was an intruder behind the door and feared for his life. That seemed reasonable enough to a court in a country that suffers from one of the world’s highest crime and murder rates. That Mr Pistorius had a gun was also not unusual. Some 2.5m of South Africa’s 51m citizens are legally registered to own guns, many of which are kept for self-defence in a country where few people have faith in the... Continue reading</description>

<title>Slim SIMS</title>
<description>EQUITY Bank, whose micro-loans offerings have helped increase the number of Kenyans using formal financial services, is looking to break into Kenya’s booming mobile telecoms market. The bank says it will use the Mobile Virtual Network Operator licence it was granted in April to make financial services even more accessible and affordable. Kenyans transacted more than US$20 billion through their mobile phones in 2013, and Kenya leads the world in its adoption of mobile payments. Equity is looking to tap into this booming market by employing innovative Taiwanese-made ultra-slim "subscriber identity modules", better known as SIM cards. The 0.1mm-thick SIM cards sit on top of a user’s existing SIM, allowing subscribers to access voice and mobile-money services from two competing operators without having to own a dual-SIM phone or have two handsets. This technology has been opposed by Safaricom, which leads the field in Kenya, not just in mobile subscribers but also in mobile money, in the form of its M-PESA service. Safaricom has said the technology puts users at risk of fraud and wants the bank to be prohibited from issuing the cards.  Safaricom has been successful in blocking the issuance for the cards for the time being. The Communications Authority of Kenya says Equity Bank must start operations using normal SIM cards until it has received expert... Continue reading</description>

<title>Fresh water in a village called death</title>
<description>LAKE Victoria is the second-largest freshwater lake in the world, and it is at Agnes Nansubuga's front door in the village of Walumbe. So naturally, that's where she used to fetch her drinking water. Unfortunately, it is also a place that many of her fellow villagers also use as a bathroom. When she drank water from the lake, "I used to get stomach pains," she says. Now, though, Ms Nansubuga not only has access to clean water herself, she also provides it to others. She works as an operator on one of the pumps that provide clean water to her village, part of a system installed by a South Carolina-based Christian missionary organisation, Water Missions International. Water is drawn from a pipe placed about 150 metres into Lake Victoria, then run through a solar-powered water filtration system back on shore, where the villagers access it through five different pumps in the community. "The community has come to understand the value of safe water," says Chrispus Oguti, the chairman of Walumbe's water committee, as he proudly explains the workings of the multi-stage filtration system, a series of three large chambers...

<title>Sharing the spoils</title>
<description>A LEAKED contract between Norway’s Statoil and the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) is raising questions about whether Tanzania will gain the full benefits of its sizeable gas deposits, the first of which was discovered deep in the Indian Ocean in 2010. Estimates put the country’s reserves at a little over 50 trillion cubic feet of gas, a figure the government thinks may double as additional exploration wells are drilled, making them potentially a considerable potential source of revenue. Arguments over how such revenue should be shared between the country and oil firms have already spilled over into public debate. Last week Tanzania's revenue authority said it would review and renegotiate mining and gas agreements. A few days later it quickly withdrew that proposal amid concerns that it might hamper investment and exploration. The bulk of the Tanzanian gas industry is still in its exploration phase, and final investment decisions on production are unlikely to be made until 2015 or 2016. But according to an IMF report released in April, once infrastructure is in place and... Continue reading</description>

<title>An inspiring book fair, a raft of challenges</title>
<description>IN a scruffy hall off the dusty main thoroughfare of Somaliland’s capital, Nuruddin Farah, a Somalia-born novelist, is berating the audience at the Hargeisa International Book Fair over what he sees as the inherent cruelty of Somali society. Somali history, he says, “is a consequence of this cruelty…we can never be a democratic society until we change our behaviour towards those we consider lesser.” Despite being born in the south of Somalia and living in Cape Town Mr Farah, probably the most well-known Somali writer, feels quite at home in the internationally-unrecognised state in Somalia’s north: “I have come to start a debate with my community”. Debate permeated the fair in August and is now in its seventh year. Jama Muse Jama, formerly an Italy-based academic and businessman and now a Hargeisa-based publisher founded the fair in 2008 as a means to allow Somalilanders “to regain their public space… to sit down and simply debate”. Alongside authors including Nadifa Mohammed, a much-lauded young British-based author born in Hargeisa, topics including the preservation of Somali heritage, mother and infant...

<title>Ebola&#039;s economic impact</title>
<description>MORE than 1,900 people have so far died from Ebola in the four affected west African countries, but many more will suffer the economic consequences. Governments reckon the worst of those effects are yet to be felt, but they are still busy trying to calculate what the outbreak is going to cost them. Here are Liberia’s thoughts: The tiny post-conflict country has been growing at upwards of 8% over the last couple of years, but won’t expect anything like that kind of luck now. The government is still number-crunching with the International Monetary Fund, but it reckons Ebola will shave more than 2% of growth rates this year, putting estimates at 3.5%. Finance minister Amara Konneh says that’s mostly because of damage done to mining, agriculture and service industries, as investors evacuate foreign workers, borders close, and international flights are suspended. Bread-basket regions are under quarantine, making agricultural trade impossible. Sime Darby, the world’s largest listed producer of oil palm, is slowing production and Sifca Group, an Ivory Coast-based agribusiness, has halted rubber exports. Mr Konneh...

<title>The great escape</title>
<description>NIGERIA’S war against Boko Haram is going from bad to worse. The country’s army, on paper the strongest in west Africa, suffered its latest humiliation in late August when some 480 soldiers fled across the border to Cameroon after coming under attack from the jihadists.  Cameroon’s ministry of defence said the Nigerian troops crossed the frontier after militants attacked a military base and police station in Gamboru Ngala, in northern Nigeria. The deserting forces apparently holed up in Maroua, some 80km (50 miles) inside Cameroon, where they were disarmed by local troops. Nigeria’s government insists this was but a “tactical manoeuvre”. It was the latest of many setbacks in the struggle to contain Boko Haram (its name means “Western education is forbidden”), which recently proclaimed an Islamic caliphate in Nigeria’s north-east, mimicking the one set up by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The security situation in the north has continued to deteriorate. Thousands of people have been killed this year. The government has failed to rescue more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in April. A large part of the problem... Continue reading</description>

<title>Talks without hope</title>
<description>NEXT Monday representatives of Mali’s government and northern Tuareg are due to meet in Algiers to initiate a new round of peace talks. International mediators have pushed for these talks since May, when Tuareg violently took power in their ethnic stronghold of Kidal, prompting the government to declare war. But it’s doubtful how much can be expected from the latest initiative in Algiers. The current discussions are the latest in decades of sporadic war and faltering deals. Tuareg rebellions are as old as Mali itself, but a 1992 peace deal set the template for more recent conflicts. In that deal Tuareg groups abandoned demands for independence and promised to disarm in return for limited autonomy, better integration into the state and army, and government schemes to foster development. But a familiar pattern has since emerged in which both sides fail to honour their pledges and dissatisfaction mounts until conflict erupts again. Similar rebellions and peace deals have followed many times, most recently from 2012-13. Malian papers often portray the Tuareg as thugs, Islamist... Continue reading</description>

<title>Spare us the gimmick</title>
<description>TO CELEBRATE Women's Month in South Africa this year, the country's arts and culture ministry has launched an unusual Twitter campaign: "Wear a Doek Fridays." A doek is a square cloth tied around the head. Women have been asked to share "doek selfies," with the ministry's official Twitter account promoting "inspiration photos" of glamorous women wearing fancy doeks. The campaign has been a social media disaster, its hashtag overrun by criticism and mockery. Although doeks can look fashionable, they are typically kerchiefs worn by black domestic workers. To many they are a sign of subservience, and critics accuse the government of promoting an unequal and submissive view of women. Female members of Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters party have in recent months worn doeks in parliament to symbolise working-class solidarity. Opposition leader Helen Zille, a white woman, was photographed wearing one during elections earlier this year, while stirring a cooking pot on the campaign trial. This went over about as well as the #WearADoek campaign. The problem, critics say, is less the doek and more the general triteness of Women's Month, which is centered around Women's Day—a national public holiday every August 9th, and a marketing boon with shops promoting specials for the "ladies." South African women face serious issues that aren't highlighted during women's... Continue reading</description>

<title>Uncontained</title>
<description>ALMOST a week after Sierra Leone's president, Ernest Bai Koroma, declared a state of emergency in response to the Ebola outbreak sweeping through West Africa, troops were finally deployed on Monday. The move, known as Operation Octopus, aims to enforce a strict quarantine of affected areas and homes that have been exposed to the disease. It is badly needed. Yet when Baobab’s correspondent visited one of four quarantine sites in the capital on Sunday, the quarantine was not being enforced. The Koroma family (no relation to the president) were entertaining guests. Neighbours freely wandered in and out of their house, and members of the family periodically left the building. Two disinterested police officers stood nearby. "They [our superiors] told us not to let them go too far" said one of them uncertainly. Saudatu Koroma, a trainee hairdresser, was the first person in the city to be infected with Ebola. She died in late July. Her family say she was killed by a witch, but the government says she tested positive for Ebola. Saudatu had fled hospital and sought the help of a local traditional healer. Many people in...

<title>Ranking high on the wrong measures</title>
<description>FOR years Africa was a backwater for al-Qaeda-linked insurgents, but today it is rising axis for extremism. Two African insurgencies now rank among the most dangerous internationally: Boko Haram in Nigeria and Somalia’s al-Shabab. Going by the number of fatalities per attack, Nigeria now has the world’s deadliest insurgency (killing an average 24 people per assault, versus two in Iraq), according to Maplecroft, a risk consultancy. Violence has spilt into neighbouring Chad, Cameroon and Niger. In Somalia, al-Shabab has come under pressure from regional African forces, but has responded by striking beyond its borders. Kenya has been particularly hard hit. Since the bloody siege on Westgate Mall in Nairobi, the capital, last year, a series of coastal attacks has cost hundreds of lives and hammered the tourism industry. Further north countries are still struggling to contain the fallout of the 2011 protests, which left behind a dangerous combination of weak governments and available weapons. Terrorist incidents have doubled in the past year in Libya, where disorganised national forces are battling with power-seeking militias. Those groups have been causing chaos in the country since Muammar Qaddafi was overthrown in 2011, with dire economic consequences. And things could get worse. Maplecroft says that the prospect of Libya descending into civil war cannot be... Continue reading</description>

<title>A pause in the killing</title>
<description>RIVAL Muslim and Christian militias from the Central African Republic (CAR) signed a ceasefire this week, which they said would protect civilians after 16 months of civil war. But there are several reasons to be sceptical about its capacity to bring an end to fighting that has killed thousands of people and displaced about a million more. Ceasefires are hard to implement at the best of times, and their track record in Africa is not encouraging. South Sudan provides a good example of how quickly they can fall apart. Leaders there have signed two agreements this year to bring an end to a political conflict that has divided the country along ethnic fault-lines since December 2013. Both were breached with depressing rapidity. The political situation in CAR will make implementing a ceasefire equally difficult. Its conflict started when mainly Muslim Seleka rebels staged a coup in March last year, bringing Michel Djotodia to power. Abuses committed under his rule prompted the creation of “anti-balaka” Christian militia, sparking a cycle of brutal ethnic violence. Mr Djotodia resigned... Continue reading</description>

<title>Operation Serval&#039;s final mission</title>
<description>Update: The wreckage of airliner AH5017 has been found in Mali. The Burkinabe army has said that the plane crashed about 50km from the border with Burkina Faso. TWO French fighter jets screamed across northern Mali on Thursday not in pursuit of terrorists, but on a far more tragic sortie. At 1.50am Air Algeria AH5017 disappeared, possibly over the country. The plane was an MD-83, carrying 116 people from Oaugadougou, Burkina Faso to Algiers. Onboard were passengers from France, Burkina Faso, Lebanon and elsewhere, and a Spanish crew. Its pilots were apparently told to alter course to avoid bad weather before contact with the flight was lost. Algeria has sent a C-130 aircraft and Mali is also looking, but the French military lead the search. Operation Serval was launched in Mali in 2013 to drive terrorists from its northern cities. This month François Hollande, France's president, declared the mission victorious, revised the mandate and changed its name, with effect from August 1st. Although the French use Malian sky freely, they do not control... Continue reading</description>

<title>Unwanted aid</title>
<description>AID in Africa has controversial reputation. Critics say it is wasteful and does little to assist the poor. Some even argue that it is counter-productive by making recipients dependent on hand-outs. Seldom, though, are western aid agencies accused of providing the funding for human rights abuses. Yet on July 14th a British court ruled that an Ethiopian man had legal grounds to ask for a judicial review of Britain’s development assistance to Ethiopia after he alleged it had led to human rights abuses. The man, identified only as Mr O to protect his identity, claimed that Britain’s Department for International Development (DFID) had contribute funding to a resettlement program that led to human rights abuses being committed on his community in Ethiopia. In arguments before the court it was alleged that Mr O was forcibly relocated from his village in the Gambella region of western Ethiopia as a result of a government “villagisation” scheme. His...

<title>Nollywood&#039;s new scoreboard</title>
<description>NIGERIAN cinephiles rejoiced this month as news emerged that "Half of a Yellow Sun" (pictured above), arguably the most ambitious film project in the nation’s history, had received a release date in its own country. For three months the nation’s media censorship board had held up the film, citing vague concerns over its depiction of the nation’s bloody Biafra War. But that is not what makes the film’s release notable. "Half of a Yellow Sun" was actually released a year ago, premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival, then finagling releases in major markets such as Britain before making it back home to Nigeria. It was a strange route for a Nigerian film, given that most of the country's output consists of cheap productions aimed primarily at a domestic market. But "Half of a Yellow Sun" is a symbol of a new wave of filmmaking and distribution that is changing the way Nigeria’s massive movie industry operates. Ever since Nollywood’s 1992 emergence, when a local importer reputedly acquired some outdated videocassette tapes and shot a cheap movie to make a quick buck,... Continue reading</description>

<title>Boko Haram extends its reach</title>
<description>After much speculation over the cause of a deadly set of explosions in Lagos last month, Boko Haram’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, released a video claiming responsibility, signifying that the Islamic insurgency has managed to hit the country’s commercial centre for the first time.   Two successive blasts in the Lagos’ port district on June 25 were passed off by the local government as mishap with a gas container. That explanation seemed a little thin. Behind closed doors, diplomats called it a cover-up designed to prevent panic. Now, Mr Shekau appears to have undermined the government’s claims: "You said it was an ordinary fire, but it was me in that fire," he said in his video. In laying claim to the bombing, Boko Haram has exacerbated concerns over its ability to reach deep into the south of the country. Lagos is the biggest city in Nigeria and the business centre for Africa’s largest economy. There have been Islamist threats against Lagos before. In May, for instance, America sounded a warning that Sheraton hotels could be a target for terrorists. Local security forces have also... Continue reading</description>

<title>We can’t help coming back</title>
<description>DURING the military intervention of France in Mali January 2013, officials in Paris were at pains to emphasise the exercise’s modest ambition. “France can intervene only in an exceptional moment, for an exceptional and limited period”, said President François Hollande, as French troops swept into the west African country to beat back a jihadist advance that was threatening Mali’s capital, Bamako. After stopping the rebels in their tracks, France, he insisted, would hand over the country’s security to African forces. A year-and-a-half later, the French are less bashful about their intentions in the region. On July 17th Mr Hollande is setting off on a trip to the Ivory Coast, Niger and Chad to herald the onset of a new counter-terrorism operation, codenamed “Barkhane”, which will aim to tackle the jihadist threat across the Sahel, the region comprising the southern fringe of the Sahara desert. On a visit two months ago to Abidjan, the Ivory Coast’s commercial capital, France’s defence minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, spoke of a muscular new policing role for France in west...

<title>Snatched</title>
<description>ANDARGACHEW TSIGE, an exiled Ethiopian opposition leader with British nationality, could be facing the death penalty after apparently being arrested and sent back to his country of origin while on a trip to the Gulf. While transiting in Yemen on June 23rd, during a journey from Dubai to Eritrea, Andargachew mysteriously ended up on a plane to Ethiopia. It is believed that he was detained by Yemeni officials and handed over to members of Ethiopia's security apparatus. Andargachew was charged by the Ethiopian authorities with terrorism and sentenced, in absentia, to death, at two separate trials between 2009 and 2012. Following post-election protests in 2005 he had fled the country and been granted asylum in Britain, where he created Ginbot 7, a leading opposition movement. Now in the hands of the state which had legally prepared for his execution, his family are concerned about Andargachew's safety. “The British embassy has still not been granted consular access,” says his wife, Yemisrach Hailemariam, who lives...

<title>A perfect storm</title>
<description>NEARLY six months after Guinea registered its first cases of the ebola virus, the outbreak is still spreading. A World Health Organisation statement last week said 467 people had died from the illness, which has been confirmed in more than 60 communities in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, including the capital cities of the former two countries. Past outbreaks have been contained and eliminated through careful tracking of individual cases. But the current outbreak has proved harder to manage. West Africa has higher population density and better roads than Central Africa, the site of previous outbreaks, meaning the illness has more opportunity to spread. Robert Garry, a virologist from Tulane University in New Orleans, points out that the current virus is less aggressive than some previous trains, meaning that infected patients are able to spread the disease farther after symptoms begin. These two factors have created a "perfect storm", he says. Superstition about ebola does not help. Many do not believe the disease is real, and conspiracy theories are running wild. In Kenema, the main treatment centre in Sierra Leone, a rumour that... Continue reading</description>

<title>A tablet a day</title>
<description>THERE are millions of children out of school in the conflict-ridden northeast of Nigeria, but in one classroom the future is looking brighter. In a co-educational private secondary school in Yola, the capital of Adamawa state, teenagers each sit in front of a computer. They are enrolled in an extra-curricular class run by the nearby American University of Nigeria (AUN), which prepares them for university degrees in science, technology, maths and engineering. At the front of the class, their teacher—an engaging doctor from the university—uses a $40 credit card-sized computer known as a ‘Raspberry Pi’ to project mathematical charts on a whiteboard. The youngsters here are bright, computer smart, and ambitious. They say they would like Nigeria to have a Chinese-style tech revolution—and their teacher agrees. This is one of 22 private schools in which AUN runs these classes. But he says this is not just something for the elite. At a few dollars apiece, he sees no reason why every school in the country should not be using this kind of technology to improve teaching outcomes. Nigeria is facing one of the...

<title>Spreading instability</title>
<description>TWO months after a hashtag brought Nigeria’s Islamic insurgency to international attention, the security situation continues to deteriorate, posing a growing crisis for Goodluck Jonathan’s embattled government. The world started paying attention after the militia group Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is forbidden”, abducted more than 200 schoolgirls from Borno state in April. But that was just one episode in a near-constant stream of violence by the insurgents, who have their stronghold in the country’s northeast. Over the past year, the number of terrorist attacks in Nigeria has almost doubled, killing close to 3,500 people, according to the risk analysis group Maplecroft. Abductions have been a common tactic of the group, which either holds hostages for ransom or sells them as slaves. But since the girls were taken, it has stepped the practice up a gear. More than 100 people have been kidnapped since May, Maplecroft reckons, implying that the organisation is increasingly using hostages to boost its international profile and bargain with the...

<title>Field of Shattered Dreams</title>
<description>FEW were surprised but many were disappointed when Africa’s dreams of World Cup victory came to an end on Monday. The football-loving continent’s last two remaining teams – from Nigeria and Algeria – were defeated in the knockout stages of the tournament, leaving a legacy that is more controversial than proud. Player strikes, pay disputes, brawls and match-fixing allegations have marred Africa’s hopes of victory in Brazil. Of the five African teams which qualified to play in the World Cup, three were involved in pay scandals. Players from Cameroon got their protest in before the tournament had even started. They refused to board a plane to Brazil following an argument over money, delaying their arrival by almost a day. Next, Ghana made a laughing stock of itself when it flew $3m in cash to Brazil to avert a match boycott by players demanding their appearance fees. Finally, Nigeria’s Super Eagles cancelled a training session ahead of the crucial knockout round in protest over bonus payments. Presidential intervention was required to settle that argument. It got worse from there. Ghana’s team... Continue reading</description>

<title>A wife as a gift</title>
<description>Better than a wife TO EXPRESS their gratitude to the visiting boss of South Africa’s state broadcaster, traditional Venda chiefs have—according to the Sowetan, a popular daily newspaper—lavished three gifts on Hlaudi Motsoeneng: a cow, a calf, and a beautiful wife. The broadcasting supremo is pictured with his arm around a bare-breasted young maiden, said to be his choice from several on offer, as they surveyed the cattle. Venda elders deny the woman was a gift, as does the woman herself. But the Sowetan insists that its report was accurate; the South African Broadcasting Corporation appeared to confirm that its boss was indeed offered a wife. Under some traditions in South Africa, women are still treated as chattels. One practice is known as ukuthwala, whereby a young girl is abducted and taken to the family home of a man, usually a lot older than herself, who wants to marry her. In response to the Venda story, a regional chairman of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa suggested that giving a wife would be acceptable if the lady and her parents consented. But many... Continue reading</description>

<title>Enfant de la Patrie</title>
<description>HE IS French, 22 years old, and comes from a quiet rural village in Normandy. He is also, the French government suspects, one of the executioners in a video released by Islamic State (IS) on November 16th which shows the beheading of 14 Syrian soldiers and Peter Kassig, an American aid worker. France has been well aware for some time of the problem of home-grown jihadist recruits. But the revelation that one of them seems to have taken part in beheadings is of an altogether different order of concern. Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, tentatively identified the young man (pictured, at right) as Maxime Hauchard, from the Norman hamlet of Bosc-Roger-en-Roumois. Stunned neighbours described a quiet boy not known to be a troublemaker. Mr Hauchard converted to Islam at the age of 17, according to French news reports, having become radicalised through the internet and social media. After two trips to Mauritania, Mr Hauchard arrived in Syria... Continue reading</description>

<title>All that glitters</title>
<description>AMONG the growing number of hard-up European governments offering residence permits to wealthy non-Europeans who invest in their countries, Portugal has been the most successful. In return for real-estate purchases and other investments totalling more than €1 billion ($1.25 billion), Portuguese authorities have issued 1,775 so-called “golden visas” over the past two years , 81% of them to Chinese nationals. But success turned to scandal on November 13th, when police made 60 raids across the country, detaining 11 people in a crackdown on suspected corruption by officials administering the scheme. Among those held were the head of Portugal’s border agency and the president of the country's registration and notary institute. Three days later, Miguel Macedo (pictured), the interior minister in the centre-right government, resigned. The investigation in Portugal, codenamed “Operation Labyrinth”, could have wider ramifications across... Continue reading</description>

<title>Yes and no</title>
<description>AFTER months of “will-they, won't-they” brinkmanship, Catalans were finally able to vote Sunday on whether they wanted to become an independent nation . In Lleida, the tranquil capital of a mostly rural province known for its fruit farms and pigs, all was calm at the city's eight voting stations. A single police officer stood outside the Josep Lladanosa secondary school, as citizens braved the winter chill to deposit their votes. The polling had no legal force; Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, contends a vote not sanctioned by Madrid would be unconstitutional, and the country's constitutional court is still deciding the question. Instead it was, depending on your point of view, either a piece of mass civil disobedience led by Catalan president Artur Mas, or an entirely legal mock referendum that puts pressure on Madrid to stage a real one. Voters (including the pro-independence marchers above) were delighted. Mobile phone selfies were the order of... Continue reading</description>

<title>How real is Osborne&#039;s &quot;real result&quot;?</title>
<description>WITH a spring in his step, George Osborne (pictured), the British finance minister, left today's meeting of European Union finance ministers announcing that he had secured a "real result" for Britain in the row over its increased EU budget contributions. Two weeks ago Britain was saddled with a surcharge of €2.1 billion ($2.6 billion), thanks to a recalculation of its national income dating back over a decade. (Other countries were presented with smaller amounts.) The monies were due on December 1st. But that bill, said Mr Osborne today, would be halved, the payment schedule delayed, and the rules permanently changed to ensure nothing like this could ever happen again.  In the run-up to today's meeting EU officials and Britain's European partners had insisted that the €2.1 billion calculation was made according to rules to which all members, including Britain, had signed up. But David Cameron, the British prime minister, insisted that Britain would pay neither on time nor "anything... Continue reading</description>

<title>Poison pen</title>
<description>TRAVELLING around Ireland a few months after it became the second euro-zone country to seek a bail-out, your correspondent was surprised to discover a shared belief among almost everyone he met: that by agreeing to the €67 billion ($87 billion) rescue, the Irish had essentially bailed out Europe rather than the other way around. Few denied that the Irish had brought their troubles upon themselves, by living high on the hog and selling vastly overpriced houses to one another. But there was a strong feeling that the European Central Bank, in particular, had bullied a small government into accepting terms for the creditors for its large banks that it would not have chosen had it acted alone. To many, that suspicion was confirmed Thursday when the ECB published a letter (leaked earlier in the day to the Continue reading</description>

<title>Of riots to come</title>
<description>A GROUP calling itself "Hooligans Against Salafists" had dutifully registered to stage a legal demonstration against jihadist Islam in central Cologne on October 26th. But on Facebook and Twitter the call quickly spread. Ultimately some 4,800 people showed up, most of them male and looking for trouble, gathering between Cologne's train station and its famous cathedral. A right-wing band called Kategorie C started playing. (Category C is German police jargon for football fans looking for a fight, as opposed to Category A, who actually want to watch football, and Category B, who while not hell-bent on fisticuffs are open to a scuffle if one presents itself.) Neo-Nazis pranced about, giving the Hitler salute. They included "SS-Siggi", a blond giant who is a celebrity in fascist circles. Beer bottles started flying. Soon, a full-fledged street battle pitted violent hooligans against 1,300 cops, about 50 of whom ended up injured. The images , reminiscent of street fighting during the Weimar republic of the 1920s, shocked Germans.... Continue reading</description>

<title>Pot calling kettle</title>
<description>BEFORE the European Parliament approved a new team for the European Commission last week (pictured), it made sure to leave its mark. Heeding the warnings of Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission's president, that this was "last chance saloon" to restore trust in the EU, MEPs eyed potential scalps among the nominees, making these the most political soundings to date. The buzzword of the interrogations was “transparency”. That was all to the good. But the EP itself has a long way to go before it lives up to the standards of transparency it sought to impose on Mr Juncker's new commissioners. For all the noisy grilling, the two big centre-right and social democrat groupings avoided taking down each other’s favourites in the hearings. Miguel Arias Cañete, energy and climate change commissioner, was harangued by left-wing MEPs over his family’s interests in two... Continue reading</description>

<title>No more Mr Nice Guy</title>
<description>WHEN Matteo Renzi (pictured)  won 41% of the Italian vote in the European Parliament election in May, there was an almost audible sigh of relief among pro-Europeans. Here at least, it seemed, was a country where voters remained loyal to the EU project. And what is more, it had a dynamic young leader who could trounce adversaries with a campaign appealing to traditional, pro-European ideals. That was always a grossly simplistic analysis. And on October 23rd the outgoing Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, found out just how wrong it was. In an act of studied contempt, Mr Renzi’s government published online the Commission’s “strictly confidential” letter demanding an explanation for Italy’s draft 2015 budget. Unveiled on October 15th, the Continue reading</description>

<title>Awkward timing</title>
<description>IT BEGAN with a bleeding nose and ended with a punch in the face. Yesterday's meeting of European Union heads of government in Brussels started inauspiciously, when the Cypriot president was taken to hospital after a series of nosebleeds; caused, said doctors, by high blood pressure. (The Greek prime minister stepped in to represent Cypriot interests.) The day ended on a yet sourer note, when it emerged that Britain would have to stump up an extra €2.1 billion ($2.7 billion) for the EU budget by December, after the European Commission revised its calculations for gross national income, on which budget contributions are partly based, over the past 20 years. Italy, the Netherlands and Greece, among others, must also pay more; deliciously, the French and the Germans will enjoy rebates of varying amounts. Commission officials were quick to point out that they were just applying rules agreed to by all EU members, including Britain, back in 2010. But the timing of the... Continue reading</description>

<title>What lies beneath</title>
<description>IT WAS as though the cold war had never ended. A hazy shape spotted by island residents in the southern Stockholm archipelago on October 17th quickly prompted suspicions of an incursion by a Russian submarine. The Swedish armed forces leapt into action, establishing a no-fly zone. The navy deployed fast-attack vessels (pictured), cordoning off a wide swath of water and forcing Swedish pleasure boaters seeking the last good autumn weather to leave. But after days of searching, the military is still not sure what, if anything, is out there. Although officially neutral and not a NATO member, Sweden is no stranger to Russian provocations. Besides the possible submarine, Russian planes have violated Swedish and Finnish airspace in recent months. Against the backdrop of Russian military intervention in Ukraine, Sweden, like other countries, is growing increasingly... Continue reading</description>

<title>Europe&#039;s first Ebola victim</title>
<description>FEAR spreads faster than disease. But when the first contagion of Ebola outside west Africa, where the disease has killed 3,400 people since March, struck in Madrid on October 6th locals worried not just about its proliferation but also about the competence of their health authorities. The first victim is a 44-year-old hospital worker, Teresa Romero, who volunteered to help when two Spanish missionaries were flown home from Africa to die of the disease. Health workers in Africa are among the disease’s most frequent victims. In the developed world hospitals have elaborate protocols to cope with the danger of contagion. Ms Romero should have worn the right protective clothing, known the safety protocols properly and been quickly spotted as a danger to public health once ill. Yet after Ms Romero caught the virus, she spent ten days on holiday in Madrid, sat a public exam and visited a health centre and hospital to seek help with her first symptoms. Ms Romero wore protective clothing at work and claimed she followed the protocols. She also rang the hospital where she worked to ask for advice on dealing with her early symptoms, but her...

<title>Tough hearings ahead</title>
<description>THE European Parliament will begin grilling the 28 candidates for the new European Commission today—and MEPs are determined to leave their mark on the new team. With the power to veto the entire commission team, the parliament has in the past successfully rejected candidates. Some parliamentarians are looking to add to that tally. MEPs are in a confident mood after outmaneuvering the European Council earlier this summer to secure the appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured) as president of the commission. David Cameron, the British prime minister. had made it his personal mission to overturn the so-called Spitzenkandidaten process, in part because of his damming take on a roll-call of Brussels insiders, but also to resist an overt power grab by the parliament. Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, shared some of Mr Cameron’s misgivings, but ultimately the council gave in. Only the controversial Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, joined Mr Cameron in voting against Mr Juncker’s appointment. Emboldened by that success, the parliament has set its sights on Mr Juncker's appointments. Britain’s Jonathan Hill is... Continue reading</description>

<title>Getting to “sí”</title>
<description>THEY put a brave face on it in Catalonia. The Scottish "no" vote , said Catalan president Artur Mas, was a triumph for democracy and an enviable example of how to resolve nationalist tension within a European state. But it was also a setback. A Scottish "yes" would have proved that a European Union state can break up, and obliged EU leaders to find a way to cope. Catalan separatists would have tried to fall into Scotland's slipstream, using its vote to boost support for a movement that has grown rapidly; some polls show a majority of Catalans favour a split. But while the Scottish referendum was jointly proposed by the British and Scottish governments, Mr Mas is treading a more dangerous path. Madrid has refused to hold a referendum , so he is going it alone. On Friday Catalonia's parliament passed a so-called “law of... Continue reading</description>

<title>The peace and safety of our throne</title>
<description>THE  troonrede , the annual speech delivered by the Dutch monarch to parliament, is in part an occasion for sounding the national mood, and in part an occasion for prominent women to wear  exceptionally silly hats . It takes place on a day the Dutch call  prinsjesdag , or Prince's Day, which also celebrates (or mourns, as the case may be) the presentation of the government's budget for the coming year. There are equestrian performances by mounted guards, King Willem-Alexander (pictured, with Queen Maxima) arrives at the  ridderzaal  (Knights' Hall) borne in the royal Golden Coach, and so forth. But this year the charming rituals of September 16th were enveloped by what the king called a "black border of mourning": the memory of the destruction of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in July, and the deaths of 196 Dutch passengers on board. That event, and the broader conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East that have dominated the news this summer, have caused a significant change in the Dutch... Continue reading</description>

<title>Valls optimism</title>
<description>MANUEL VALLS (pictured), the reformist French prime minister, faces a trying parliamentary vote of confidence in his Socialist government today, as he tries to face down backbench rebels unhappy with the direction of economic policy. This will be his first vote of confidence since a government reshuffle in August, and Mr Valls has raised the stakes, declaring that times are sombre, that his party should behave responsibly and that the far-right National Front is “at the gates of power”. The government needs an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly in order to survive the vote. Failure to secure this would lead to fresh legislative elections and prompt a political crisis in France. Mr Valls survived a previous vote of confidence back in April, shortly after his nomination by President François Hollande, by a margin of 33 votes. At a later vote on the social-security budget in July, however, the gap shrank to just 18. Since then, a group of Socialist rebels has... Continue reading</description>

<title>The transformation of German politics</title>
<description>THE place to be on election nights these days in Germany is not inside the respective state parliament but at whatever restaurant the Alternative for Germany has rented that evening. So it was two weeks ago in Dresden , when Saxons voted and swept the Alternative, an anti-euro and generally conservative party founded only last year, into its first state parliament. So it was again yesterday in Potsdam and Erfurt, when Brandenburgers and Thuringians voted and gave the Alternative two even greater triumphs: 10.6% in Thuringia and 12.2% in Brandenburg. I chose to hear the evening's first estimate at 6PM with supporters and leaders of the Alternative in an elegant restaurant inside a neo-Baroque courtyard near Brandenburg's newly restored state parliament. When the bar charts came up on the screen, the room erupted in a roar and then shook for minutes of clapping and howling.  All the Continue reading</description>

<title>Left turn</title>
<description>Stefan Löfven, leader of Sweden's Social Democrats IN THE end the gap proved too big to close. For weeks the centre-right alliance under Fredrik Reinfeldt had been chipping away at the big lead of the centre-left block, led by the Social Democrats' Stefan Löfven. But after the election on September 14th Mr Reinfeldt conceded defeat and resigned as prime minister. He also said he would step down as leader of the Moderate Party. Yet it will not prove easy for Mr Löfven to take his place. The Social Democrats, the Greens and the Left Party took 43.6% of the vote to the alliance's 39.5%. Mr Löfven can happily work with the Greens, but not so well with the ex-communist left. He is talking of trying to prise away smaller parties in the alliance, but will find that extremely hard. The far-right Sweden Democrats, with whom... Continue reading</description>

<title>Valérie thanks François</title>
<description>“I RUN into the bathroom. I grab the little plastic bag containing sleeping pills…François follows me. He tries to seize the bag. I run into the bedroom. He grabs the bag, which rips open. Pills spill all over the bed and the floor. I manage to recover some. I swallow what I can.” It reads like one of those French art-house movies about theatrical marital breakdown, shot in close-up and set in an elegant apartment. Except that this is not fiction, but real life, as recounted by Valérie Trierweiler, the former partner of François Hollande, the Socialist president, whose tell-all book on their split—“Merci pour ce moment”—is published on September 4th. It is unusual to find a serving head of state’s private life chronicled in excruciating detail by his ex-partner. For the French, who have traditionally considered the public interest to stop at the bedroom door, it is an earthquake. Mr Hollande is said to have known nothing about the book. Ms Trierweiler, a journalist, wrote and published it in secret. Extracts published early in Paris-Match , a weekly where Ms Trierweiler works, do not flatter Mr Hollande. She...

<title>Another little piece of Europe shifts right</title>
<description>AS ONE, the supporters of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), founded only last year, cheered into the echoing vault they had rented for their election-night party next to the river Elbe in Dresden. The evening's first projection on August 31st had just put the AfD near 10% of the vote in Saxony, clearly above the 5% threshold to enter that state's parliament. Moments later, Frauke Petry (pictured), the party's boss in Saxony, entered and was mobbed as though she were a rockstar. Great work, she beamed back at her fans, but the real effort only starts now: In two weeks, the Alternative also wants to enter the state parliaments of Brandenburg and Thuringia. The AfD began as a single-issue party, calling for an orderly unravelling of the euro. In the past year, it has added piecemeal other positions, from an increase in direct democracy to a return to conservative economics. At times--as in Saxony, where it is strongest--it has also mixed xenophobic innuendo into its messages. Although it pulls voters from all the other parties, it is most successful on the right.  The Alternative's newest success, coming hard on the heels of its entry... Continue reading</description>

<title>Back to work</title>
<description>UNUSUALLY for a European Union summit, this one was supposed to wrap up early. "We're hoping to be done by nine o'clock," said one British official cheerfully, as proceedings kicked off yesterday evening in Brussels. But it was closer to 1.00am by the time the club's 28 leaders clambered wearily into their limousines. There turned out to be rather a lot to discuss. The European Council summit, the first ever to be held in August, was arranged last month after the EU's leaders failed to agree on the appointment of two senior positions: the president of the Council, who oversees meetings and tries to find common ground among leaders, and the high representative for foreign affairs. In the days and weeks leading up to last night Herman van Rompuy, who holds the former position, worked the phones hard to arrive at something close to a consensus. It worked: the jobs discussion was concluded crisply (see below).  It proved a little trickier to find agreement around two weightier matters: how to kickstart the sluggish European economy, and how to...

<title>No more Cuban-style policies?</title>
<description>IN MANY respects, the new French government, which was unveiled today, looks a lot like the old one. The reformist Manuel Valls is still prime minister. Laurent Fabius stays on as foreign minister; Michel Sapin continues as finance minister; Jean-Yves Le Drian keeps his job at defence; Ségolène Royal remains in charge of the environment and energy; Bernard Cazeneuve stays at the interior ministry. But there was one big surprise, as symbolic as it was encouraging: the appointment of Emmanuel Macron (pictured) to replace Arnaud Montebourg as industry and economy minister. Aged only 36, Mr Macron was until June this year economic adviser at the Elysée, the presidential palace, where he saw it as his mission to steer the Socialist government under President François Hollande away from its paleo-thinking towards a more modern form of social democracy. Mr Macron resigned after Mr Hollande installed the moderate Mr Valls as prime minister, arguing that this job was done. If Mr Valls wanted to send a message with his new government, Mr Macron is it. Mr Montebourg, who was ousted the previous day, had a knack of irking foreign... Continue reading</description>

<title>The government goes</title>
<description>THE entire French government resigned unexpectedly today after bitter internal disagreements over economic policy. In a statement, President François Hollande announced that his prime minister, Manuel Valls (pictured left), who has been in the job for only five months, would name a new team tomorrow. Much depends on the new line-up, but the best outcome could—just possibly—be an end to the contradictions and muddle that have marked economic policy ever since Mr Hollande, a Socialist, was elected president in 2012. The immediate trigger for this reshuffle was a weekend interview in Le Monde , a daily, followed by a political rally on August 24th, in which Arnaud Montebourg, the economy minister and long-time anti-austerity advocate, lashed out at Mr Valls’s economic policy. Enforced deficit reduction, he said, was an “economic aberration” and “financial absurdity”. France should not align itself with the “ideological axioms of the German right”, he added, and an alternative... Continue reading</description>

<title>A painful decision</title>
<description>FOR other weapons exporters, the decision was easy. The Islamic State (IS) has overrun and terrorised swathes of Iraq and Syria. Germany is, with Britain and France, one of Europe’s biggest arms-makers. Fears of the possible genocide of Iraq’s Yazidis and brutality like the beheading of an American journalist, James Foley, have made dealing with IS especially urgent. Yet the German government tiptoed carefully into its announcement that it had decided to arm Kurdish forces to break IS’s momentum. Germany vocally opposed the 2003 war in Iraq, and the chaos of the past decade there has bolstered voters’ conviction that this was the right decision. Germany’s traditional post-war pacifism has made any involvement, even in less-controversial wars like Kosovo or Afghanistan, ticklish. The government is keeping its plans vague for now. This has been taken to mean that the deliveries will, at first, include bulletproof vests, night-goggles and transport. Whether and when deadly weapons will also be supplied is another question. The region has shown a repeated ability to surprise. IS fighters are well armed with weapons originally... Continue reading</description>

<title>Righteous in Holland and Gaza</title>
<description>HENK ZANOLI (pictured) is a 91-year-old retired Dutch lawyer whose personal history encapsulates the reasons why the Netherlands and Israel have had such friendly relations since the foundation of the Jewish state in the wake of the second world war. Mr Zanoli's family was, as the Dutch put it, "right in the war"—i.e. members of the resistance. In 1943 Mr Zanoli escorted an 11-year-old Jewish boy from Amsterdam, Elchanan Pinto, back to the family home in the village of Eemnes, where he and his mother Johanna hid him for the rest of the war. (His father, Henk Senior, had already been sent to a concentration camp for his resistance activities; he would die at Mauthausen.) Mr Pinto subsequently emigrated to Israel. Three years ago, the Israeli Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem awarded its "Righteous Among the Nations" medal , given to non-Jews who rescued Jews from the Nazis, to Mr Zanoli and (posthumously) his mother. On August 11th  Haaretz 's  Amira Hass reports , Mr Zanoli sent... Continue reading</description>

<title>Erdogan wins</title>
<description>TURKEY’S prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan (pictured with his wife), became the country’s first popularly elected president yesterday, marking his ninth consecutive electoral victory during 12 years in power. He received 52% of the vote, averting the need for a runoff. The strong result will have a profound impact on the future of Turkey’s shaky democracy. In a victory speech at the headquarters of his Justice and Development (AK) party in Ankara, Mr Erdogan declared that this was the “start of a new era”, signalling his intentions to continue to rule the country from the presidential palace and to give Turkey a new constitution that would, among other things, give him executive powers. As president Mr Erdogan pledged to embrace all citizens
